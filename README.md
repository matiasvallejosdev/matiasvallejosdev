### Who Am I?

Software developer _- Python / C# / AWS / Unity3D / Coding -_ with a passion for technology and programming. Good performance working in a team and with other people. Proactive at all times. I'm autodidactic. I want to continue growing in the development industry.

### When I started to code?

I started coding when I was 18 years old, at first it was just curiosity as a university student, curiosity of how machines can predict the future? How are video games made? Parallel to university then, I began to search for information on Google, YouTube and to take a wide variety of courses on Udemy, Udacity, Coursera where I began to learn progressively.

### My Skills
```Python
import json
with open('skills.json', 'r') as f:
    skills = json.load(f)
  
print(json.dumps(skills, indent=4))
